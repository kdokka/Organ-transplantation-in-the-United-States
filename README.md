# Organ-transplantation-in-the-United-States

Organ transplantation is one of the greatest advances in modern science. It is the last option exercised to save patient's life when all other viable treatment options have failed.

At this moment, about 72,742 patients are waiting for an organ donation in the United States alone.

UNOS provides historical data about organ transplantation dating back to 1988. Using the dataset obtained from UNOS.org, I asked the following questions:

(1) To date, which organ was the most transplanted in adult patients?

(2) Over the past 20 years, which organ transplantation showed greatest increase in adult patients?

(3) In pediatric patients, which organ was the most transplanted to date?

(4) In pediatric patients, which is the most common medical condition underlying the most transplanted organ?

(5) In pediatric patients, is the most frequent medical condition underlying the most transplanted organ equally prevalent in children of all ages?

(6) Comparing adults with pediatric patients, does the most frequent cause of organ tranplant continue in adults as well?
